This code is using the lazy function from React to perform code 
splitting and load the Login component lazily only when it's needed. 
This can help improve the performance of the application by reducing 
the amount of initial JavaScript that needs to be loaded.

The fallback prop of the Suspense component is used to specify what
 to display while the lazy-loaded component is being loaded. In this 
 case, a simple "Loading..." message is being displayed.

The Switch component from react-router-dom is being used to
conditionally render a specific route depending on the URL path.
In this case, the Login component is being rendered when the
URL path matches /login.
